Initially used Gemini API but hit response limits

Faced issue integrating API in frontend directly

Learned about environment variables

API key security confusion

Git warnings about CRLF

First time pushing backend folder

Confusion about git tracking

🎨 Frontend Struggles

Think about:

Did UI break at some point?

CORS issue?

Fetch not working?

JSON parsing issue?

Button not triggering?

State not updating?

Chat history not displaying?

CSS alignment problem?

There were definitely moments where:
“Why is this not working???”

Write those.

🧠 What You Learned

Environment variables

Git workflow

API architecture

MongoDB integration

Backend routing

Debugging calmly

This becomes GOLD in viva.

When examiner asks:
“What challenges did you face?”

You don’t say:
“Nothing.” -->
